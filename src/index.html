      content="FBook is a prototype developed in angular to replicate very basic functionalities of any social media platform. 
    I, Indranil Bhattacharya, developed this app just to experiment with different technologies and UI toolkit available out there such as Tailwind, SCSS etc. 
    with some advanced features provided by Angular such as PWA and Angular Universal for server side rendering. 
    This is a personal project and not for any commercial use. Please enjoy the app!. 
    ~ Made with ❤️ in Angular"
